My parents, ages 61 and 63, are teaching at China Foreign Affairs University. With fresh eyes toward China, they immediately identified a strange and unexpected behavior from their Chinese students. When they would ask a student's opinion about something, they would always dodge the question and reply with a neutral answer to avoid offending anyone. Here is a typical interaction that I made up to illustrate this point.

**Teacher:** "Do you like cheese?"

**Student:** "I recognize that cheese is a part of the diet of many people around the world."

**Teacher:** "Yes, but do you like it?"

**Student:** "Well, some people like it because of its creamy texture."

**Teacher:** "Do you like cheese?"

**Student:** "It has many characteristics that are enjoyable."

**Teacher:** "No, you're not answering the question. Do you like cheese?"

**Student:** "Well, to be honest, it's hard to say exactly if I like it or not."

**Teacher:** "Just answer the question: do you like cheese?"

**Student:** "No, I don't like cheese."

**Teacher:** "Finally! There we go. We have heard your opinion. Why don't you like cheese?"

**Student:** "Because I don't digest cheese very well."

**Teacher:** "That makes sense! Thanks for sharing your opinion."

## Cultural Differences

In Chinese culture, there is a strong emphasis on forming a well-rounded and thoroughly informed opinion before expressing it. The goal is to arrive at the most accurate and truthful perspective possible. This approach reflects a desire to be the decision-maker and to take full responsibility for the consequences of that decision. Once an opinion is articulated, it is often seen as definitive, marking the conclusion of the discussion.

In American culture, opinions are often held more flexibly, seen as part of a larger, interconnected framework of ideas. The focus is less on being right or wrong and more on contributing to the conversation. By sharing diverse viewpoints, individuals can collectively assess the situation from multiple angles. This approach allows for opinions to be fluid and adaptable, encouraging open dialogue and the evolution of thought as part of a collaborative cognitive process.

## A Symbol of Strength and Flexibility

A tree is a powerful symbol of both strength and adaptability. Its roots anchor it firmly in the ground, providing stability and nourishment. This grounding is akin to having strong opinions, which are well-founded and deeply considered. Just as a tree draws sustenance from its roots, strong opinions are nourished by knowledge, experience, and critical thinking.

However, a tree is also flexible. Its branches and trunk can sway with the wind, bending without breaking. This flexibility allows it to withstand storms and adapt to changing conditions. Similarly, the concept of "strong opinions, weakly held" emphasizes the importance of being open to new information and perspectives. While your opinions are grounded in solid reasoning, they should also be adaptable, allowing you to adjust and refine them as you encounter new evidence or insights.

## Strong Opinions, Weakly Held

The phrase "strong opinions, weakly held" captures a mindset that combines conviction with flexibility. The phrase was coined by Stanford's Paul Saffo, who comments:

> “Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the ‘strong opinion’ part. Then –and this is the ‘weakly held’ part– prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.”

While it's important to have well-thought-out and confident opinions, it's equally crucial to remain open to new information and perspectives that might challenge or refine those beliefs.

At its core, this approach encourages you to be curious and willing to learn. The world is constantly changing, and new information can provide valuable insights that might alter your understanding. Engaging in conversations with people who have different viewpoints can broaden your perspective and help you refine your opinions. It's about valuing dialogue and recognizing that no single perspective is infallible.

## Advice for Chinese Students

For Chinese students studying in the West, it's important to embrace openness and communication. Western education values diverse perspectives, so don't hesitate to share your opinions in class discussions. Your unique viewpoint enriches the learning environment. At the same time, be receptive to new ideas and willing to adjust your views when presented with compelling evidence. This flexibility is a sign of intellectual growth and maturity. Approach your studies with curiosity and a willingness to learn from others, as this journey is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about personal development and embracing diverse perspectives.

## Prove Yourself Wrong as Quickly as Possible

As a final thought, consider Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynmann's advice:
> "We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress!"
