# Hymn Arrangements

Besides my work in localization, technology, and education, I enjoy producing music. In 2017, I recorded an album of hymn arrangements with my brothers Levi Lambson and Peter Lambson. I published those hymn arrangements on my previous WordPress site, but as I’ve transitioned from WordPress to Jekyll, I have moved my music to SoundCloud.

Go to [SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/jJAEVaHrTD6ectDt8) to hear more, or listen in the player below.

The album art for *lighting our way* comes from a painting I acquired in Tomsk, Russia. I don’t know the artist’s name. I love how the painting depicts the frozen Siberian landscape aglow with warm, golden sunlight.

All the songs on this album are arrangements of hymns by my brothers and me. The album is multi-instrumental: piano, violin, cello, and acoustic guitar.

I hope this music conveys the love of Christ, which my brothers and I have felt in abundance.
