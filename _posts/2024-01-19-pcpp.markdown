Today I passed the PCPP exam. It's the third level in the sequence of PCEP (entry-level), PCAP (associate-level), and PCPP (professional-level). Unlike the PCAP and PCEP, the content of this exam was both broad and deep. I spent dozens of hours studying for the exam. I purchased [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/pcpp1-become-certified-professional-in-python-programming-1/) on Udemy which helped a lot. I highly recommend it.

# Why Python
As a staff localization engineer, I make decisions about software and technology stacks that enable my fellow engineers to work more effectively. Python is a key part of that stack for several reasons.

 - Python is easy to learn. By nature of our business, localization engineers typically come from university language programs, but don't have much programming experience. Python is easy to learn and there are plenty of resources available.

 - Python is easy to write. Localization tasks often come in with an urgent deadline. Speed makes the difference between getting the client's business and losing it. Because projects can be so large, with file counts in the hundreds or thousands, manually preparing files won't work. You need to automate. When time is ticking, Python is the language that allows you to write up some code very quickly and use it immediately.

 - Python is well-supported. Python is one of the most well-supported and well-documented programming languages online. You can find tutorials on any topic in any language, whether English, Chinese, or Russian. Python is supported by a wide range of well-established third-party libraries like pandas for data science and lxml for xml manipulation. These libraries are the bread and butter of localization engineering.

 # What's on the PCPP Exam

The PCPP exam is split into five areas:

1. Advanced Object Oriented Programming: this module is the most in-depth of the five of them. It's essential knowledge. This module gives you kep skills in building classes.
2. Coding Conventions, Best Practices, and Standarization: I enjoyed this module for its usefulness and applicability to a team. When everyone follows coding conventions, best practices, and standardization, it makes everyone's life easier.
3. GUI Programming (20%) This is one of my favorites because now I build graphical user interfaces all the time. I like the simplicity of tkinter, and strangely, I have come to prefer the .pack() method over .grid() and .place(). It's more elegant, and if you're smart, you can still make it look great.
4. Network programming. I use the skills here a lot as I interact with APIs for machine translation or AI.
5. File Processing and Communicating with a Programâ€™s Environment: This one is so applicable because localization engineers deal with files so often.

# The PCPP is Essential
Localization engineers should absolutely consider getting PCPP certified. The skills taught by this exam are foundational to any localization engineer's work.
