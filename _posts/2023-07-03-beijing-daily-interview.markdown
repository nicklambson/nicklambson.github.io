Beijing Daily, an online newspaper, interviewed me to get my thoughts about Beijing's Central Axis, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can read the article in Chinese [here](https://beijing.qianlong.com/2023/0703/8062548.shtml). Below is a machine translation of the article.

American Teacher's Adventure on Beijing’s Central Axis: "The City's Design is Truly Impressive!"

July 1, 2023

"Absolutely magnificent!" exclaimed Nick Lambson as he gazed southward from the top of the Drum Tower along the ancient Central Axis, captivated by the city's spatial symmetry and architectural elegance. Lambson, an esteemed American teacher from Beijing Language and Culture University, recently joined fellow foreign experts and students on a memorable exploration of Beijing’s historic Central Axis.

At 5 p.m., the day's final drum performance commenced, and Lambson eagerly ascended to the second floor of the Drum Tower to witness the grand display. The resounding, powerful beats of the drums left him mesmerized, prompting Lambson to capture a photograph of the performers in action. Through insightful explanations by experts in Beijing’s historical and cultural preservation, as well as staff from the city's planning and design institute, Lambson learned that the Bell and Drum Towers were ancient timekeeping edifices symbolizing Beijing's significant historical stature. “The rich history of Beijing is what draws me to this city,” Lambson remarked.

A Utah native from Salt Lake City, Lambson’s love for Beijing brought him not only to work in the city but to also find a life partner here. For the past five years, he has been imparting knowledge in translation technology and computer programming at Beijing Language and Culture University, while raising two adorable children.

Over these five years, exploring Beijing has become one of Lambson’s favorite pastimes outside of work. In 2019, when his family visited, Lambson proudly took them on a tour of Yonghe Temple. Last October, he and his wife commemorated their wedding anniversary amidst the autumn hues of Fragrant Hills. His adventures and experiences have gradually transformed Lambson into a fluent “Beijing expert.”

Lambson shared that the Central Axis expedition deepened his appreciation for Beijing. From the Drum Tower, the group journeyed south to Wannian Bridge and strolled through Yandai Xiejie to reach Yinding Bridge, where the breathtaking “Yinding Mountain View” unfolded before them. Lambson admired the city’s efforts to preserve its scenic beauty. Walking past Ping’an Avenue, the group learned about the “Green Wave” environmental improvement initiative launched in 2020. Today, Ping’an Avenue is a harmonious blend of continuous greenways, towering scholar trees, lush shrubs, bustling traffic, and serene hutongs on either side.

As they reached Jingshan Park, marking the end of their Central Axis exploration, the view deeply moved Lambson. "This is the most memorable part of my journey. The orderly city layout is visible in all its grandeur. Beijing’s urban design is truly astonishing!" he proclaimed, capturing a sunset selfie with the distant Forbidden City.

“Beijing’s Central Axis perfectly balances the city’s traditional and modern facets. Through this axis, I see how Beijing has maintained its cultural heritage amidst technological advancements,” Lambson stated. He eagerly hopes that this spectacular “line” will be recognized globally, allowing international visitors to understand Chinese philosophies on social order and urban planning, while also experiencing the majesty of this great city.
