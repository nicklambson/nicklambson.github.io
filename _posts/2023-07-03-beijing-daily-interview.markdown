American Teacher's Adventure on Beijing’s Central Axis: "The City's Design is Truly Impressive!"

July 1, 2023

"Absolutely magnificent!" exclaimed Nick Lambson as he gazed southward from the top of the Drum Tower along the ancient Central Axis, captivated by the city's spatial symmetry and architectural elegance. Lambson, an esteemed American teacher from Beijing Language and Culture University, recently joined fellow foreign experts and students on a memorable exploration of Beijing’s historic Central Axis.

At 5 p.m., the day's final drum performance commenced, and Lambson eagerly ascended to the second floor of the Drum Tower to witness the grand display. The resounding, powerful beats of the drums left him mesmerized, prompting Lambson to capture a photograph of the performers in action. Through insightful explanations by experts in Beijing’s historical and cultural preservation, as well as staff from the city's planning and design institute, Lambson learned that the Bell and Drum Towers were ancient timekeeping edifices symbolizing Beijing's significant historical stature. “The rich history of Beijing is what draws me to this city,” Lambson remarked.

A Utah native from Salt Lake City, Lambson’s love for Beijing brought him not only to work in the city but to also find a life partner here. For the past five years, he has been imparting knowledge in translation technology and computer programming at Beijing Language and Culture University, while raising two adorable children.

Over these five years, exploring Beijing has become one of Lambson’s favorite pastimes outside of work. In 2019, when his family visited, Lambson proudly took them on a tour of Yonghe Temple. Last October, he and his wife commemorated their wedding anniversary amidst the autumn hues of Fragrant Hills. His adventures and experiences have gradually transformed Lambson into a fluent “Beijing expert.”

Lambson shared that the Central Axis expedition deepened his appreciation for Beijing. From the Drum Tower, the group journeyed south to Wannian Bridge and strolled through Yandai Xiejie to reach Yinding Bridge, where the breathtaking “Yinding Mountain View” unfolded before them. Lambson admired the city’s efforts to preserve its scenic beauty. Walking past Ping’an Avenue, the group learned about the “Green Wave” environmental improvement initiative launched in 2020. Today, Ping’an Avenue is a harmonious blend of continuous greenways, towering scholar trees, lush shrubs, bustling traffic, and serene hutongs on either side.

As they reached Jingshan Park, marking the end of their Central Axis exploration, the view deeply moved Lambson. "This is the most memorable part of my journey. The orderly city layout is visible in all its grandeur. Beijing’s urban design is truly astonishing!" he proclaimed, capturing a sunset selfie with the distant Forbidden City.

“Beijing’s Central Axis perfectly balances the city’s traditional and modern facets. Through this axis, I see how Beijing has maintained its cultural heritage amidst technological advancements,” Lambson stated. He eagerly hopes that this spectacular “line” will be recognized globally, allowing international visitors to understand Chinese philosophies on social order and urban planning, while also experiencing the majesty of this great city.

# My Writeup of the Event

BLCU arranged for its foreign teachers to visit the Drum Tower, the Grand Canal, and Jing Shan Park in central Beijing. An expert from the Beijing Municipal Commission of Planning and Natural Resources explained the significance of Beijing’s Bell and Drum towers.

The Bell and Drum Towers in Beijing were used to announce the time of day. The Drum Tower was used to keep time during the night hours, while the Bell Tower kept time during the day. The towers were also used to signal other events, such as the opening and closing of the city gates, the start and end of work hours, and the time for curfew. They were also used to announce important news, such as the death of an emperor or the start of a war.

In addition to their practical functions, the Bell and Drum Towers were also important symbols of Beijing's power and authority. They were located on the central axis of the city, which was the most important axis in Chinese geomancy.

Percussionists took the stage to give us a thundering demonstration of the massive drums!

We then strolled south along the water’s edge of Qianhai reservoir, dazzled by the afternoon sun gleaming off the water’s surface. Another expert showed us the Grand Canal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the longest artificial waterway in the world. She explained that the Grand Canal is a testament to the ingenuity and engineering skills of the Chinese people. The Song dynasty government official and engineer Qiao Weiyue put his invention of the pound lock to good use in the Grand Canal, allowing control of the water level in the canal. Boats could now travel through sections of the canal that were at different elevations. The Grand Canal furthered economic development and remains in heavy use today by barges carrying bulk materials and containers.

After admiring the engineering marvel of the Grand Canal, we hiked up the hill of Beijing’s Jing Shan Park, once a private imperial garden for the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Arriving at the top of the hill, it’s easy to see why this was a favorite spot of emperors. The panoramic views were jaw-dropping. To the south, the hot summer sun radiated down on the orange roofs of the Forbidden City, accentuating the orderly and often symmetrical urban planning. To the east, the China World Trade Center and the CCTV Tower sparkled in the bright sunlight. To the west, the White Pagoda jutted out from Beihai park. Far in the distance, the clear air afforded a view of the Western Hills, a mountain range west of Beijing.

At the top of the hill at Jing Shan Park, I marveled at Beijing’s orderly city layout. That moment, I had a flashback of my hometown, Salt Lake City. Both Beijing and Salt Lake City were designed on a grid around a central axis. The similarities are striking. Beijing’s Central Axis and the Forbidden City is at its center, whereas Salt Lake City straddles Main Street, with Temple Square at its center. Beijing’s Jing Shan Park and Salt Lake City’s Ensign Peak both serve as vantage points with spectacular views.

After an exhilarating excursion, we welcomed the opportunity to relax on the cool bus as we rode back to the restaurant on the fifth floor of BLCU’s canteen to enjoy a Beijing classic: Peking roast duck. The conversation was lively, the drinks were refreshing, and the food was sumptuous and filling.

Beijing is a model for any city with a traditional past adapting to a vibrant future. Beijing’s modern conveniences are a marvel, but what’s even more impressive is maintaining Beijing’s traditional character throughout its technological growth. I especially enjoy being a teacher at Beijing Language and Culture University, known as the “Little United Nations” for all of the foreign students who come to study Chinese here. Beijing’s Central Axis symbolizes the balance between its traditional heritage and vibrant future, between its role as the Chinese capital and a global crossroads.

Beijing’s Central Axis definitely deserves consideration as a World Heritage site. Although several other cities have a central axis, only Beijing’s Central Axis is an incarnation of a philosophical principle, the Chinese virtue of the Golden Mean. It is an embodiment of the uniquely Chinese emphasis on social order, philosophy, and urban planning. I sincerely hope to see Beijing’s Central Axis join Beijing’s other monuments as a formally recognized UNESCO World Heritage site. I invite visitors to Beijing to experience the spectacular symmetry of Beijing’s Central Axis from the top of Jing Shan Park.
