This training is equipped with a top teaching team. The course content is rich and the forms are diverse, covering multiple links such as theme lectures, group exercises, exchanges and discussions, morning sharing, and results presentations. We have invited Chen Mingming, former executive vice president of the China Translators Association, Ma Jianchun, former director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Ministry of Commerce, Paul Heaney , secretary general of the Berne Association, Nick Lambson , a senior American teacher at the School of Advanced Translation and Interpretation of Beijing Language and Culture University , Shi Xiaojing, professor at the Monterey Institute of International Studies of Middlebury University, Yang Yueming, vice dean of the Institute of Cultural Innovation and Communication of Beijing Normal University, Huang Caizi, secretary general of the Chinese Protocol and Etiquette Culture Professional Committee, and Zhang Zhouxiang, senior reporter of China Daily, to give lectures to the trainees.
The training received unanimous praise from the trainees, who said that they had gained a lot and benefited a lot. The experts' explanations were novel in theory, combined with a large number of practical cases, and the teaching mode was novel and diverse. Everyone resonated and benefited a lot. We hope that we can continue to communicate more in the future, learn from each other, and promote each other.

This training was jointly organized by the Institute of Contemporary China and the World and China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation. It innovatively combined international export credit insurance business with the cultivation of international communication talents and the "going out" of Chinese overseas corporate culture, and achieved good results. In the future, the Institute of Contemporary China and the World will strengthen cooperation with more relevant institutions and provide support for the cultivation of national translation and international communication talents in the new era by co-hosting various translation and international communication training activities.
