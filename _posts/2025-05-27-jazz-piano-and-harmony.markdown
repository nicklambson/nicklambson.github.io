On May 27, 2025, the School of Arts at Beijing Language and Culture University successfully held its 22nd Lunchtime Concert. For this event, we were honored to have special guest Mr. Nick Lambson, a senior foreign lecturer at BLCU, share on the topic “Jazz Piano Harmony and Improvisation.” Mr. Lambson graduated from Brigham Young University in the United States, majoring in Sound Recording Technology with an emphasis on jazz piano performance. He currently serves as a senior foreign lecturer at the School of English and International Studies. Over 50 faculty members and students, including Dean Chen Xia and Deputy Party Secretary (acting as Secretary) Zhang Wenqiang, participated in the event.

The concert began with a lively jazz piano piece performed by Mr. Lambson, setting an energetic and creative tone for the event. From basic harmonic theory to jazz-style chord progressions, and then to an in-depth analysis of classic scores, Mr. Lambson used vivid performance and detailed explanation to lead students into the fascinating world of jazz music.

The activity not only deepened students’ understanding of piano improvisational accompaniment but also broadened their learning perspectives in related fields. The all-English presentation further enhanced their grasp and practical ability with professional terminology.

Finally, the event concluded amid enthusiastic applause. Deputy Secretary Zhang Wenqiang congratulated the success of the event, encouraging students to apply what they learned in practice, to keep exploring music, broaden their horizons, push their limits, and achieve excellent results.

Music knows no borders, and art connects hearts. Mr. Lambson's presentation not only showcased the charm of jazz but also demonstrated the transcendent power of music. As the piano sounded, faculty and students from different cultural backgrounds resonated together—showing the most touching meaning of music: it needs no translation, yet speaks directly to the soul, allowing the world to meet in melody.

The School of Arts carries forward BLCU’s red gene of “serving the nation through language and revitalizing the nation through culture.” With an emphasis on artistic specialties, it is dedicated to telling the story of Chinese art and promoting exchange and mutual learning among world civilizations. More activities are coming up, and all teachers and students are welcome to participate!
