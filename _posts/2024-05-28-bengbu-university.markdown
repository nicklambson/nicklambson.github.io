Friends at the Bengbu University School of Translation invited me to deliver a guest lecture to their faculty and student body on uses of AI for cultural translation.

# AI for Slogan Translation

Some time ago, I was asked to translate the slogan for the China Agricultural University International Convention Center: 我们一直在用心！ A word-for-word translation of this phrase might be "We always work with heart!" But this word-for-word translation will not suffice. The project manager desired a more idiomatic translation that rhymed.

Instead of using AI to translate directly, I used AI as a brainstorming assistant. First, I described the emotions conveyed by the Chinese expression: dedication, hard work, heart, and warmth. I then prompted GPT-4 to brainstorm slogans that express these emotions:

 - Integrity First
 - Achieve Together
 - Commit. Succeed.
 - Honor. Commit. Succeed.
 - Dream & Do

 The project manager desired slogans that rhymed, so I prompted GPT-4 to give me rhyming slogans:

 - Trust and strive, succeed and thrive
 - Commitment and honesty lead to victory
 - Dedication and integrity for common prosperity

These slogans were decent, but the project manager wanted the word "heart." I prompted GPT-4 to generate slogans with the word "heart."

 - Put your heart into it
 - Lead with heart

I really liked "Lead with heart" but the client wanted something with parallel structure. GPT-4 helped out here:

 - Work smart, work with heart

Almost there! The project manager wanted parallel structure and symmetrical syllables. Here, GPT-4 did pretty well:

 - Stand apart, work with heart
 - Do your part, work with heart

 I combined my favorite responses of GPT-4 to create the slogan I like best: **Stand Apart, Lead with Heart**.
