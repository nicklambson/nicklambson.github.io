## Event Smmary

On December 29, 2023, I spoke at the _International Conference on Translation Discipline Construction and the Cultivation of International Communication Talent in the New Era_ in Fuyang, China. My host, Shining, was very gracious. I was also pleased to meet two other language professionals in China: Kizito Tekwa from Shenzhen Technology University, and Muhammad Afzaal, from Shanghai International Studies University. I hope to visit Fuyang again some time!

In this presentation, I explained why I teach programming to translators: because it equips them with the tools to effectively bridge language gaps using technology. Programming, especially in Python, helps them tackle tasks like localization and machine translation more efficiently. I believe Python skills will be instrumental to any translation and localization job in our AI future.

### Equipping Translators for Global Success

Below is an AI summary of my presentation.

**Introduction and Objectives**

In his presentation on December 29, 2023, at Beijing Language and Culture University, Nick Lambson explored how equipping translators with vital technical skills aids Chinese companies in expanding globally. He aligned this goal with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, emphasizing the creation of new markets for Chinese products.

**Driving Global Market Expansion**

Mr. Lambson highlighted the Belt and Road Initiative as a transformative force for creating international markets. He emphasized the importance of multilingual content for consumer engagement, sharing the key insight, “Can’t read, won’t buy.” This assertion underscored the necessity of language support in global business ventures.

**Mastering Localization Skills**

He taught that localization involves more than translation—it's about adapting products to suit different cultural and linguistic contexts. Mr. Lambson integrated diverse subjects like globalization, cultural frameworks, AI, and economics into the curriculum, ensuring students are well-prepared for practical applications.

**Harnessing Technical Proficiency with Python**

Mr. Lambson promoted Python as an essential tool in localization tasks, highlighting its ease of use and power. He trained students in database management, software development, and machine translation, categorizing these skills into defined proficiency stages, from basic concepts to advanced multilingual app development.

**Innovative Educational Approach**

Under Mr. Lambson’s guidance, students followed a structured four-semester Python skills map, blending linguistic, technical, and managerial education. He focused on real-world applicability, stressing the importance of professional experience over purely academic credentials.

**Showcasing Student Achievements**

He showcased impressive group projects in video game, and multimedia localization, demonstrating the practical use of acquired skills. Mr. Lambson celebrated the success of BLCU graduates, who have excelled as they have attended excellent graduate schools such as the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Carnegie Mellon University, and Columbia University. Students have also gone on to work as engineers and project managers at Didi (China's Uber), Baidu, Tencent, and more.

**Encouraging Specialization and Growth**

Mr. Lambson invited students to specialize in localization, highlighting its practicality and the industry's fast-paced evolution. He concluded by encouraging a focus on professional experience to effectively meet the goals of globalization.

**Conclusion**

Nick Lambson's presentation provided a comprehensive framework for preparing translators to meet the demands of a global market, grounded in practical skills and real-world application.
