## Role of Localization Engineer within Application Software and Game Industries

**Marco Pirrone:** Can you briefly describe the role of Localization Engineer professional profile within application software and game industries?

**Nicholas Lambson:**  
A localization engineer facilitates the technical parts of a localization project. For websites, games, or apps, a localization engineer can work on either the client side or the vendor side. My experience is exclusively from the vendor side, providing localization services for a range of different clients, whether for video games, apps, websites, or software.

## Required Technical and Communicative Skills

**Marco Pirrone:** In your opinion, what kinds of technical and communicative skills should be possessed by Localization Engineers, especially in order to act as bridgers profiles between programmers and localizers?

**Nicholas Lambson:**  
We can divide localization engineer skills into two broad categories: hard (technical) and soft (communicative) skills.

### Technical (Hard) Skills

- **Understanding Content Types:** Engineers should know how to handle various types of content, including Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Adobe publishing files ([InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html), [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)), technical documentation, and software strings ([Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/localization/), [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/intro/index.html)). They may also encounter web content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), XML/XHTML, and even game development software like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [GODOT](https://godotengine.org/), or [Clickteam Fusion](https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5). Video localization and subtitle handling (e.g., SRT format), internationalisation standards, and localization-specific file formats ([XLIFF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.1/xliff-core-v2.1.html), [TMX](https://www.gala-global.org/tmx-14b), [TBX](https://www.tbxinfo.net/)) are also important areas.
- **CAT Tools and TMS:** Proficiency with CAT tools (e.g., memoQ) and Translation Management Systems (TMS) like RWS World Server, XTM, or Phrase.
- **Specialty Tools:** Tools such as [ApSIC Xbench](https://www.xbench.net/), and open-source solutions like [Okapi](https://okapiframework.org/) Rainbow for software localization.
- **Programming and Automation:** Strong programming ability, particularly in Python, to automate repetitive localization tasks and for natural language processing, machine learning, and AI. [Regular expressions](https://regex101.com/), IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), version control ([GitHub](https://github.com/)), and basic scripting in Excel/Word ([VBA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office)) are beneficial.
- **Enterprise Systems:** Understanding systems such as [Microsoft SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration), and localization industry platforms like [XTRF](https://xtrf.eu/) or [Plunet](https://www.plunet.com/).
- **Machine Translation and AI:** Familiarity with machine translation systems, data cleaning, system training, and prompt engineering, particularly for automated QA.
  
### Soft Skills

- **Work Estimation:** Ability to give accurate time/work estimates, with a range for best- and worst-case scenarios.
- **Data Analysis and Presentation:** Skills in data science, including analysis, processing, and presenting localization project data.
- **Process Documentation:** Capability to document processes and workflows for company knowledge bases, aiding continuity if someone needs to cover for you.
- **Technical Writing:** Ability to write clear technical/process documentation.
- **Project Management:** Organizing project requirements, milestones, and progress, and sometimes managing teams of engineers.
- **Issue Tracking and Troubleshooting:** Managing the progress of multi-language, multi-file projects and resolving technical issues for project managers/translators.
- **Responsibility and Ownership:** Admitting and learning from mistakes, using tools like [Root Cause Analysis](https://asq.org/quality-resources/root-cause-analysis) (RCA) and [Corrective Action Reports](https://sixsigmadsi.com/glossary/corrective-action-report) (CAR), especially in [ISO-certified](https://www.iso.org/certification.html) environments.
- **Language and Orthography Knowledge:** Understanding the differences between languages/scripts and being able to spot linguistic issues, such as the difference between Mandarin/Cantonese or Simplified/Traditional Chinese, and the orthography of various scripts.
- **Collaborative Communication:** Willingness to ask for help when needed and effectively communicate with both technical and non-technical colleagues.

## Reference Support Tools and Operative Approaches

**Marco Pirrone:** Can you mention some reference support tools and operative approaches which can be useful during localization engineering tasks?

**Nicholas Lambson:**  
My top advice is to learn [Python](https://www.python.org/). Alongside that, become proficient with CAT tools like [SDL Trados Studio](https://www.rws.com/translation/software/trados-studio/) and [memoQ](https://www.memoq.com/), and explore tools like [Okapi Rainbow](https://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php/Rainbow). Also, improving skills with prompt engineering will be highly beneficial as you advance in your localization engineering career.

## Open Challenges in the Field

**Marco Pirrone:** Can you briefly describe some of the main open challenges in this field?

**Nicholas Lambson:**  
Some primary challenges include:

- **Contextual Awareness:** Localization professionals must have as much project context as possible to ensure quality, especially in projects like video games where narrative context is crucial. Existing tools often lack sufficient contextual support.
- **MT and AI Integration:** Successfully integrating machine translation and AI into localization workflows requires understanding their strengths/limitations and proper placement within projects. Assessing MT quality using metrics like [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) scores and [GEMBA](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/GEMBA) is essential, and tools like [Intento](https://inten.to/) help connect to various MT engines (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.). Custom MT solutions and data cleaning are also vital.
- **Source File Management:** Not all client-provided file formats are suitable; engineers often need to request format changes.
- **Automation and Documentation:** There's an ongoing need to enhance automation via programming and to improve process documentation, but not all engineers have the required programming or technical writing skills.
- **Variety and Technical Familiarity:** The sheer range of content types/projects requires extensive training and continuous learning; a specialized academic path would help address this gap.

## Standard Framework and Entry Requirements

**Marco Pirrone:** How would you suggest to create a standard framework for this professional profile? What kinds of degrees and/or other entry requirements would you consider?

**Nicholas Lambson:**  
There isnâ€™t currently a dedicated degree program in localization engineering. You can enter the field from backgrounds in software engineering, computer science, linguistics, or translation studies, but combining these areas is uncommon.

### Recommended Framework

- **Core Focus:** A curriculum with around 80% technical skills and 20% language/linguistic skills.
- **Background Differences:** Vendor-side engineers often come from language backgrounds and add technical skills, while client-side engineers often come from technical backgrounds.
- **Recommended Degrees:**  
    - Computer Science / Software Engineering
    - Information Technology / Information Systems
    - Data Science
    - Foreign Languages / Translation Studies / Linguistics

### Suggested University Program (Sample Courses)
- Computer-assisted translation tools
- Advanced business applications
- Industrial economy
- Python programming (4 semesters recommended)
- Natural language processing
- Data science
- Linguistics and translation theory
- Localization engineering using Python (2 semesters)

### Additional Recommendations

Programming skills are absolutely critical. When starting my career, I didn't know Python, but learning it enabled me to automate many tasks and develop tools for localization. I achieved the PCPP certification from the Python Institute, which offers three levels: [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) (entry-level), [PCAP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap) (associate), and [PCPP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcpp) (professional).
