On November 22, 2025, I joined the 产学研融合助力构建智能语言服务人才培养新生态论坛 to explore how LangOps is reshaping language services in the post-localization era. Below is the core of my talk, along with space to capture insights from the other inspiring speakers who shared the stage.

## Why LangOps Matters Now

The language industry has crossed into a post-localization reality where language is no longer a stand-alone deliverable—it is an embedded capability inside every product workflow. LangOps gives enterprises a governance and automation model that treats multilingual operations like any other mission-critical system: observable, API-addressable, and ready to scale on demand.

## Modular, API-Native Infrastructure

Legacy workflows are dissolving into modular services that expose APIs for content ingestion, transformation, enrichment, and delivery. By abstracting translation memory, terminology, quality checks, and orchestration into callable services, we unlock a plug-and-play architecture that supports both human linguists and autonomous agents.

## Knowledge Graphs Meet Structured Language Assets

Translation memories and termbases evolve fastest when they are paired with knowledge graphs and structured data formats. Linking linguistic assets to product taxonomies, regulatory rules, and customer personas enables context-rich retrieval for both humans and machines. The result is content that is instantly discoverable, governance-ready, and machine readable.

## Designing for Human and Machine Consumers

Artificial intelligence agents are becoming their own audience segment. They expect consistently tagged metadata, executable instructions, and policy-aware outputs. When we adopt LangOps principles, every deliverable—UI copy, support macros, acoustic models—ships with the annotations, provenance, and trust signals that human end users and AI intermediaries both require.

## The LangOps Stack, Layer by Layer

- **Experience Layer:** Omnichannel content surfaces that adapt to user intent and device context.
- **Automation Layer:** Event-driven pipelines coordinating MT, QE, routing, and human-in-the-loop steps.
- **Knowledge Layer:** Unified translation memory, terminology, knowledge graphs, and evaluation datasets.
- **Runtime Layer:** API gateways, TMS connectors, LLM orchestration, and policy enforcement.
- **Observability Layer:** Metrics, tracing, and feedback loops measuring throughput, quality, and cost in real time.

## Toward 24/7 Integrated Language Capabilities

The LangOps journey moves from tool-centric efficiency to autonomous, policy-compliant language capabilities that run continuously. I outlined roadmaps that start with inventorying current assets, then formalizing service-level objectives, harmonizing data contracts, and finally enabling closed-loop optimization between human reviewers, automated agents, and business systems.
